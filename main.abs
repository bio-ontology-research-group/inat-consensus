The digitization of biodiversity in extreme environments, such as the Rub' al Khali (Empty Quarter), relies increasingly on citizen science platforms like iNaturalist. However, the data produced is not static; taxonomic identifications evolve through community consensus, creating a provenance challenge for the Semantic Web. We present a generalized, configurable ETL pipeline and formal OWL 2 DL ontology to model this dynamic ecosystem. Using the Rub' al Khali project as a primary case study, we demonstrate a system that integrates iNaturalist data with the NCBI Taxonomy to detect epistemic conflicts between agents. We separate the TBox (consensus logic) from the ABox (observation data), enabling automated reasoning over conflicting evidence and providing a rigorous structure for integrating shifting classifications into the Linked Open Data cloud.
